        <h2>Your App Idea Shouldn't Stay Just an Idea</h2>

        <p class="lead">You've had that app idea for months (maybe years). You know it could help people. You know it could generate income. But every time you try to move forward, you hit the same walls:</p>

        <div class="pain-points">
            <div class="pain-point">
                <h3>The Traditional Way Costs $10,000+</h3>
                <p>Hiring developers is expensive. Outsourcing is risky. You're not even sure if your idea will work, but you're supposed to invest thousands upfront? That's backwards.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="pain-point">
                <h3>Learning to Code Takes 12+ Months</h3>
                <p>You tried the tutorials. You started the bootcamp. But between learning syntax, debugging errors, and figuring out which framework to use, your motivation died. The finish line kept moving further away.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="pain-point">
                <h3>You Feel "Not Technical Enough"</h3>
                <p>Everyone says "just learn to code," but they don't understand. You're not a developer. You don't think like a developer. The whole world of Xcode, Swift, and Stack Overflow feels like a foreign language you'll never speak fluently.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="pain-point">
                <h3>Meanwhile, Your Idea Sits There</h3>
                <p>Months turn into years. You see similar apps launch. You think "I had that idea!" But having the idea doesn't count. Only execution counts. And you're stuck.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p class="problem-summary"><strong>Here's the truth:</strong> Until now, building apps required either money you don't want to risk or technical skills that take years to develop. So your app idea stayed exactly where it started—in your head.</p>

            <p>I'm a former garden designer. I never took a CS class. I'm not "naturally technical." But I've built and launched multiple iOS apps that generate real revenue—all using Claude Code.</p>

            <p><strong>If I can go from designing flower gardens to building revenue-generating apps, you can too.</strong></p>

            <p>I've created a complete system that takes you from "I have an app idea" to "My app is live in the App Store with paying subscribers" in 6 weeks. No coding background required. No technical degree needed. Just you, Claude Code, and a structured plan.</p>

                <p>When AI coding tools emerged, everything changed. <strong>I built my first app in 6 weeks.</strong> Then another. Then another. Some generate revenue. Some taught me valuable lessons. All of them proved the same thing:</p>

                <li><strong>You can commit 10-15 hours per week</strong> for 6 weeks to make this happen</li>
                <li><strong>You have a Mac computer</strong> (required for iOS development)</li>
                <li><strong>You're willing to invest $99 in Apple Developer</strong> and ~$20-30/month for Claude Code</li>

                <li><strong>You can't commit 10-15 hours per week.</strong> You need time to watch modules, build your app, and iterate based on feedback. Less time = you won't finish.</li>
                <li><strong>You don't have a Mac.</strong> iOS development requires macOS and Xcode. No Mac = you can't build iOS apps. (This is an Apple requirement, not mine.)</li>
                <li><strong>You're not willing to invest in required tools.</strong> You'll need Apple Developer ($99/year) and Claude Code (~$20-30/month). If that's not doable right now, wait until it is.</li>
                <li><strong>You want to build the next Facebook.</strong> We're building simple to moderate complexity apps. Think: productivity tools, trackers, niche utilities. Not social networks or complex games.</li>
                <li><strong>You need someone to do it for you.</strong> I'll guide you, but you're building YOUR app. This requires your active participation.</li>

        <h2>Meet Katie: Your Not-So-Technical Guide</h2>

        <div class="instructor-bio">

                [IMAGE: Friendly, approachable photo of you at your desk or with your apps on phone]
            </div>

            <div class="bio-content">
                <p>Hi, I'm Katie. I run FlowerFarming.com and spent years as a garden designer. My technical background? Zero. My CS degree? Nonexistent. My coding experience before 2022? I once tried a Python tutorial and gave up after 3 days.</p>

                <p><strong>I am not naturally technical.</strong> And that's exactly why I'm the right person to teach you.</p>

                <p>When I started building apps with AI, I made every mistake you can imagine. I submitted apps that got rejected. I built features that didn't work. I got stuck so many times I lost count. But I figured it out—not because I'm smarter or more technical, but because I was stubborn enough to keep going.</p>

                <p>Now I've built and launched multiple iOS apps. Some generate revenue from subscriptions. Some taught me what NOT to do (equally valuable). All of them proved that <strong>you don't need a technical background—you need a system and someone to show you what actually works.</strong></p>

                <h3>Why I Created This Course</h3>
                <p>Because every time I tell someone I build apps, they say the same thing: "I have an app idea but I don't know how to code."</p>

                <p>And I think: <em>You don't have to know how to code anymore.</em></p>

                <p>AI has changed everything. But most tutorials assume you already know development. Most courses are taught by engineers who've been coding for 20 years. They can't remember what it's like to be a complete beginner.</p>

                <p><strong>I remember.</strong> I was a beginner 2 years ago. I know exactly where you'll get confused, what questions you'll have, and how to explain things in plain English without jargon.</p>

                <p>This course is everything I wish existed when I started. If a garden designer can build revenue-generating apps, you absolutely can too.</p>

                <p>Here's the deal: This course works. I've built the system, tested the process, and removed every obstacle I can think of. But I can't do the work for you.</p>

                <p><strong>So here's my guarantee:</strong></p>

                <p>Complete the modules. Show up to the calls (or watch recordings). Build your app following the system. Submit it to Apple within 90 days.</p>

                <p>If you do all that and still don't submit your app, email me proof that you did the work, and I'll refund 100% of your investment. No questions, no hassle.</p>

                <p>This isn't a "try it and see" guarantee where you can watch one module and ask for a refund. This is a "do the work and if it doesn't work for you, you get your money back" guarantee.</p>

                <p><strong>Why this guarantee?</strong> Because I want you to have skin in the game, but I don't want you to take financial risk. If you show up and do the work, you'll get your app submitted. I'm that confident.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-list">
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do I need coding experience?</h3>
                <p><strong>No.</strong> This course is designed for complete beginners. You'll use Claude Code (AI) to write the code while you guide it in plain English. If you can describe what you want your app to do, you can build it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do I need a Mac?</h3>
                <p><strong>Yes.</strong> iOS development requires macOS and Xcode, which only runs on Mac computers. This is an Apple requirement, not mine. If you don't have a Mac, you'll need to get one before starting the course.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How much time per week do I need?</h3>
                <p><strong>10-15 hours per week</strong> is realistic. Some weeks might be less, some might be more depending on your app's complexity. This includes watching modules, building your app, and troubleshooting. If you can't commit this time, you won't finish in 6 weeks.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What if I don't have an app idea yet?</h3>
                <p><strong>That's fine.</strong> Module 3 includes an app ideation framework to help you come up with something buildable in 6 weeks. We'll also discuss ideas in the community and during live calls. The key is picking something simple enough to finish.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I build any type of app?</h3>
                <p><strong>Simple to moderate complexity apps, yes.</strong> Think: productivity tools, trackers, simple utilities, content apps. Not: social networks, complex games, apps requiring custom backends or real-time features. During the course, we'll help you scope your idea to something achievable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What if I get stuck?</h3>
                <p><strong>You have multiple support options:</strong> Weekly live Q&A calls where you can ask me directly, a private community of fellow students solving similar problems, and 100+ pre-written prompts for common scenarios. Getting stuck is normal—we've built support systems specifically for that.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do I need to pay Apple $99?</h3>
                <p><strong>Yes.</strong> To publish apps on the App Store, you must enroll in the Apple Developer Program, which costs $99/year. This is separate from the course fee and goes directly to Apple. Without it, you can build apps but not publish them.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How much does Claude Code cost?</h3>
                <p><strong>Approximately $20-30/month</strong> depending on your usage. Claude offers a subscription plan that gives you access to Claude Code. This is in addition to the course fee and is required to use AI for building your app.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What if I miss a live call?</h3>
                <p><strong>All calls are recorded.</strong> You'll get access to recordings within 24 hours of each call. Watch on your own schedule. The live calls are valuable for real-time Q&A, but missing one won't set you back.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is there a refund policy?</h3>
                <p><strong>Yes—90-day money-back guarantee.</strong> Complete the course, follow the system, and submit your app within 90 days. If you do that and still don't get your app submitted, show me proof of your work and I'll refund 100%. See the guarantee section above for details.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Will my app make money?</h3>
                <p><strong>That depends on your app, marketing, and execution.</strong> This course teaches you how to build and monetize apps with subscriptions. I'll show you the technical setup for Revenue Cat and Superwall. But whether your specific app generates revenue depends on whether people want it and how well you market it. I can't guarantee your app's success—only that you'll know how to build and monetize it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I build multiple apps with these skills?</h3>
                <p><strong>Absolutely.</strong> Once you finish this course, you'll know the complete process from idea to App Store. You can build as many apps as you want. Many students start with one app and immediately begin planning their next.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What if AI tools change?</h3>
                <p><strong>You get free updates.</strong> As Claude Code and iOS development tools evolve, I update the course content. Your $397 includes lifetime access to all updates. You're not buying a static course—you're getting ongoing access to the current best practices.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is this better than hiring a developer?</h3>
                <p><strong>For learning and first apps, yes.</strong> Hiring developers costs $10,000+ and you learn nothing. You stay dependent on developers forever. Building it yourself means you learn the skill, own the process, and can iterate quickly without paying hourly rates. For complex apps, you might eventually hire developers—but you'll understand what they're doing and communicate better.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>I tried learning to code before and failed. Will this be different?</h3>
                <p><strong>Yes, because you're not learning to code.</strong> You're learning to direct AI to code for you. Traditional coding tutorials teach syntax, data structures, algorithms—things that take months to understand. This course teaches you to describe what you want and let AI handle the implementation. Completely different skill set.</p>
